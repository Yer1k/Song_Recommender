## Introduction
This Github Repo supports a song recommendation system that is built by data pulled from Kaggle via Spotify API. The recommendation system enables users to get suggestions based on 3 aspects:
* Popularity of the music/song
* Artist
* Distinguishing musical characteristics of the song

To create this recommendation system, we divided the project into 7 key steps:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Building out a song popularity recommender
4. Building out a song similarity recommender based on artist
5. Building out a song similarity recommender based on song characteristics/features
6. Testing all components
7. Combining into a single song recommendation system

Below is a illustrative flow chart outlining these 7 steps:
